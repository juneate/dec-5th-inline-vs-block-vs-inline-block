  <p><code>.inline-list > li</code> selects list items (li) that DIRECTLY (>) descend from the .inline-list branch of the document:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyle list-inline">
  <li>Intro</li>
  <li>Lessons of Note</li>
  <li>Grades</li>
  <li>Topics</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a type selector (li) is less problematic here (in terms of best practice and scalability) because it's qualified by a specific parent.</p>
<p>Using two different parent classes for two different things (unstyling and inlining) make those classes independently reusable because they're decoupled from each other and this specific implementation of those classes.</p>
